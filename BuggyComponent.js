In React Native, especially when working with complex UI components or asynchronous operations, a common yet elusive bug is caused by incorrect state management or improper handling of component lifecycles.  A component might not update as expected due to stale closures, shallow comparisons failing in `setState`, or race conditions in asynchronous calls.  For instance, fetching data in `componentDidMount` and updating state might lead to a race condition if the component unmounts before the data arrives, resulting in a stale closure accessing a non-existent component.
